    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

            Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes

            Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

            Once hot, add the paneer and cook for 3-5 min until golden, turning occasionally for even colouring
        </li>
        <li>
            While the paneer is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion[s]

            Once the paneer is golden, transfer it to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat with 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] vegetable oil

            Once hot, add the sliced onion with a big pinch of salt, 2 tsp [3 tsp] sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until soft and starting to caramelise

            Meanwhile, boil half a kettle
        </li> 
        <li>
            Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

            Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

            Once the butter has melted, add the crushed cardamom and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 300ml [600ml] cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

            Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

            Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving
        </li>
        <li>

            While the rice is cooking, deseed the green pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

            Add the pepper strips to the softened onion and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown, stirring occasionally

            While the vegetables are browning, dissolve the vegetable stock cube[s] in 300ml [600ml] boiled water
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

            Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

            Cut the tomatoes into wedges

            Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until the vegetables are coated
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 min, then return the paneer cubes to the pan with the tomato wedges and vegetable stock

            Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 5-10 min or until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your paneer jalfrezi

            Meanwhile, add the plain naans to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through

            Taste the paneer jalfrezi for seasoning, adding some pepper if you like it hot

            Fluff the cooked basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter – this is your buttery cardamom rice

            Serve the paneer jalfrezi with the buttery cardamom rice and warmed naan to the side (discarding the cardamom pods!)
