        <li>5g coriander</li>
        <li>4 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp five-spice mix</li>
        <li>15ml soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 white potatoes</li>
        <li>1 spring onion</li>
        <li>25g honey</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

            Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips then add them to a baking tray with half [all] the five-spice, a drizzle of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp [1 tsp] sugar and lots of salt and pepper

            Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp
        </li>
        <li>
            While the chips are cooking, chop the chicken breast portions into strips

            Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very large drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

            Add the chicken strips to a bowl with the cornflour and give it a good mix up until all the chicken is coated
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 4-5 min on each side until golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your crispy chicken

            Once crispy, transfer to a plate and set aside (reserve the pan for later!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the red pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into small cubes

            Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

            Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

            Finely slice the red chilli[es] into rounds

            Trim, then finely slice the spring onion[s]
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with any of the remaining oil left from the chicken

            Add the chopped pepper, chopped ginger and half the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and cook for 3-4 min or until fragrant

            Meanwhile, add the soy sauce to a bowl with the honey, chilli jam and Chinese rice wine – this is your sticky chilli sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sticky chilli sauce to the pan and cook for 3 min or until the sauce begins to thicken and the pepper has softened

            While the sauce thickens, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

            Once thickened, add the crispy chicken to the pan and cook for 1 min further until the chicken is coated in the sauce – this is your sticky chicken
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the chips are cooked, add the remaining chopped garlic, sliced spring onion and chilli round (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the tray and give everything a good mix up – these are your salt & pepper chips

            Serve the sticky chicken with the salt & pepper chips to the side

            Garnish the chicken with the chopped coriander

            Enjoy!
