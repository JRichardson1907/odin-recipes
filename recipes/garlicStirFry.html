        <li>4 cloves of garlic minced</li>

        Steps:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil a large pot of water. Cook the noodles according to package directions until cooked through. Drain and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together all of the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Adjust the seasoning to taste if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the noodles cook, heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until starting to become tender, about 3 minutes. Add the broccoli, and cook for another 2 minutes until the broccoli turns bright green.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cooked noodles and sauce mixture, folding gently to combine. Continue to cook for about 3 more minutes, or until the sauce is thickened slightly and heated throughout. Serve hot, garnished with spring onion and sesame seeds if desired.
